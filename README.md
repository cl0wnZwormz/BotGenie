    To get your Discord token go into Discord Web open inspect element, go to console, type "allow pasting". After that run the following command:
    
    ```
    window.webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([
    [Math.random()],
    {},
    req => {
        if (!req.c) return;
        for (const m of Object.keys(req.c)
        .map(x => req.c[x].exports)
        .filter(x => x)) {
        if (m.default && m.default.getToken !== undefined) {
            return copy(m.default.getToken());
        }
        if (m.getToken !== undefined) {
            return copy(m.getToken());
        }
        }
    },
    ]);
    console.log('%cWorked!', 'font-size: 50px');
    console.log(`%cYou now have your token in the clipboard!`, 'font-size: 16px');
    ```
